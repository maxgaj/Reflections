What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	You need to do it to indicate to git it needs to track the files in this repository
	git creates an hidden folder with the meta-data it needs
	git doesn't create an initial commit, you have to do it yourself

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?
	
	the stagging area contains the file from the directory that we want to track with git
	the repository contains the history of every file in the stagging area
	it's useful if we don't want to track some files from the directory

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?
