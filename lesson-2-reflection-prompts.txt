What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	You need to do it to indicate to git it needs to track the files in this repository
	git creates an hidden folder with the meta-data it needs
	git doesn't create an initial commit, you have to do it yourself

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?
	
	the stagging area contains the file from the directory that we want to track with git
	the repository contains the history of every file in the stagging area
	it's useful if we don't want to track some files from the directory

	Addition from Denyos
		The files are not yet in the repository so you can still add/remove files from the staging area before making a commit.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?
	
	the stagging area allows you to choose wich files will be in the next commit
	you can separate and group changes on different file into commit that makes sense 

	Addition from drownwagon
		By using "git diff --staged", you can see which changes that you will include in your commit. 

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history
organized? How would branches help?

	when you want to try a new feature or when you want to create a different version while working on the master version


How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

	you can have several branches to lives along.
	A diagram help you visualize wich commit are reachable on each branch

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in
the diagram the way we do?

	all the changes from the two branches are merged together
	the two branches are reunited by a single commit
	this new commit allows you to access the history of the two branches
	git log shows you all the commit sorted by timestamp
	to know which commit is the parent of which, it's easier to represent the history on a diagram

What are the pros and cons of Git's automatic merging vs. always doing merges
manually?

	automatic merging saves you a lot of time sinc for most of the time, there is no conflict
	but in case of a conflict, it can lead to unconsistent merging

Commands:
Addition from Denyos
	git add  |    Add a file to the staging area
	git commit  |    Commit the files from the staging area to the repository 
	git status  |    Show which files are in the staging area, and which files from the working directory are not part of the repository    
	git diff  |    Git diff without arguments is comparing the working directory with the staging area
	git diff --staged  |    Compare the staging area with the repository
	git reset --hard  |    Undo all changes! There is no rollback for this, so be carefull!
	git checkout master  |    Restore the "Head" to the latest check-in (this will be part of a later lesson/module)
	git log --graph --oneline <branch1> <branch2>  |    Show a visual representation of the commit history within different branches
	git checkout -b new_branch_name  |    Creates a new branch and do a checkout on this branch in one call instead of git branch new_branch_name and git checkout new_branch_name
	git merge branch1 branch2  |    Merge two branches, branch2 get merged into branch1
	git branch -d name  |    Remove the branch with the specified name
	git show commitId | Show the changes made in this commit compared to the previous version. This is working even after merging.
