When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  
  This can be useful if you are working on different computer, you can keep your work synced in all your working station
  It is also a great tool if you are working with other people
  Even if you are working alone on a single computer, it's good to have a back-up only if your computer breaks.
